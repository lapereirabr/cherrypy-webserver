cherrypy-webserver
==================

A web service written in Python making use of the cherrypy, requests, and json libraries


This project was written for CSE30332 at the University of Notre Dame. The goal of the project was to gain familiarity
with writing RESTful web services while also learning more about the power of the object-oriented paradigm.

It is worth noting that all of the test files in this repository were provided to me by my professor as a means of 
checking the functionality of each individual service.
